# Synopsis
The game is basically another rip off of Minecraft except this time you're on the moon. You play as a robot pilot, who crash landed on a moon and is forced to survive against weird alien crabs.

# Game Play Summary
I've actually played this game before a long time ago, and the goal is still unknown to me. As far as I know, all you do is go around mineing cubes of different materials and fight aliens. You can build structures and craft items, but can hardly understand what they are exactly some times because of the whole sifi theme.
## Playability
I'd say the playability is pretty low, due to the awkward controls and features such as the materials and building. Combat as well. It's hard to quickly switch from your mineing mode to a combat mode. You can only hold  
### Single/Multiplayer
It's supposed to be multiplayer but I don't see any other players, so maybe it's for friends only.
### Controls
It's really uncomfortable at first when it comes to the controls, even after getting used to them, you still feel awkward about them.
# Bugs
The area aound you still generates as you stand in it, meaning a chunk of blocks can spawn on to you and you would be stuck inside. That was the first thing that happened to me when i started the game.

There are two mini space crafts you can use to fly around. I tried to seee how far up in the sky I could go then jumped out the ship, landed, and died. I got into the second ship and couldn't fly it. When I tried to exit the ship, I spawned at the first ship which was still in the sky. So It stopped falling after I died and now I'm having to fly it back down.
# Final Thoughts
The game really could've been good, but there was too much wrong and too much missing. The game was only a dollar so I can't really complain, but there were pretty bad bugs and the game just wasn't fun. The setting should've taken place on a differnet planet rather than just a plane moon. A moon is too boring and has nothing to do. I had my friends play this one with me for a bit and the connection was ok, but not too good. You can't pause when other players are there so that made it harder when it came to combat.
