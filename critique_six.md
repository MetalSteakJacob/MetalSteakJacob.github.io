# Synopsis
The game is basically another rip off of Minecraft except this time you're on the moon. You play as a robot pilot, who crash landed on a moon and is forced to survive against weird alien crabs.

# Game Play Summary
I've actually played this game before a long time ago, and the goal is still unknown to me. As far as I know, all you do is go around mineing cubes of different materials and fight aliens. You can build structures and craft items, but can hardly understand what they are exactly some times because of the whole sifi theme.
## Playability
It's really uncomfortable at first when it comes to the controls, even after getting used to them, you still feel awekward about them.
### Single/Multiplayer
It's supposed to be multiplayer but I don't see any other players, so maybe it's for friends only.
