# Synopsis
A well made RPG game. The music and graphics are great, and it is challenging and entertaining.

# Game Play Summary
Playing it reminded me of Final Fantasy or Pokemon when it came to battling. It was a little hard to read what was going on because the naration was on the top of the screen while everything else was on the bottom.
## Playability
The Usability is great. It walks you through everything at the beginning and then let's you play while still leading you on to which way to go.
### Single/Multiplayer
Single
### Controls
The controls were my favorite part. They were nowhere near awkward. 'Z','Enter', or 'Right Click' would be used as the action button. 'X' or 'Esc' would be used for cancel or exit. Movement was the arrow keys. I prefer WASD for movement, but because of the simplicity, I'm satisfied.
# Bugs
I messed with the buttons, especially movment, and found that the movment of the character can fall behind a little if you give it too many commands.
# Final Thoughts
This was the best quality game I've tested so far. There wasn't too much for me to review because I really didn't find anything wrong other than the battling naration and movement. There really wasn't much to break because of how linear it was. For example, you walk through a city, but there's only one way you can go because of brick walls and other objects blocking other paths. The game is also supposed to be released in early 2018, so whatever bugs were there before were probably fixed by now.
