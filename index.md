### *Game Critique 9/21*


Space Fighter is an online, PC game where you play as a space ship orbiting around a moon or asteroid from what it looks like. You fly around and shoot down other players with lazer bullets or missiles. You can also choose different ships.

Almost everything is wrong with the game, it may just be my computer, but I don't find it to be playable. I had to lower the quality of the graphics and sounds, and turn off some special effects in order to see where i was going.

The music seems to be a playlist of different space themed music but there's a long minute pause between each song. the sound effects are off by half a second when you shoot lazers out the ship.

Playing the game itself can leave you hanging a lot. There are no directions on what button does what, and you don't even know you're playing against other people until the match ends and see the scoreboard. By that, I mean when you start the game, it just starts. There's no countdown or "match start" or any sort of information on what you're doing. I've also found that when you go out of bounds, you can see the end of the world itself. It's too obvious to see that the floor is just a small plane with grey space underneath.

There's a special missile you use, and when you launch it, you play as it to guide it to the target, but your ship is still flying so it can still get shot or crash. I was later able to find the controls but when you exit it and go back to the menu, it's blank. It still has the background and music but there's no "start" or "options" so i was left to guess "okay, maybe i should press space"  then the actual menu comes up. I was able to find that it only happens when you're on the controls menu for too long.

Also I tried playing as the other types of ships. They all look different, but when you click on one, you're still left with the default ship.

### *Game Critique 9/26*

"You Doesn't Exist" I found this title to be really odd for a medieval rpg game. At first it reminded me of pokemon. You wake up from a bed, go downstairs to meet your mom, and go out to the world. But when it came to the fighting, it took me a while to understand it, and I had a hard time reading everything because the battle menu was on the bottom of the screen, while the narration was on the top. I got the hang of it later and actually enjoyed playing it.
After playing it for a little longer now, I found out it's not a medieval game at all. This game confuses the player by constantly changing the setting of the game. First im in a medieval world, killing dragons, then it turns out I'm a kid playing on the computer, who also happens to be simulation of someone in the future, sleeping in a dream pod. The loop goes on and I still don't know whats really going on. But the reason why this is important is because the quality of the game changes as well, but it's hard to tell if these bugs were on purpose or not. The only thing I found that I know is a bug is if you spam the directional buttons, the character will spin in a circle for about a full second. There was also a part where I died and the menu changed to where some selections were missing, but I'm not sure if that was part of the game because dying plays a part in the plot as well. The game is basically several games in one, and you have to play each of them a certain way to go to another game. So I'm thinking a good test would be to go through the loop of games several times until you mess up the whole thing, which I think is highly possible, considering the loop of games is completely random and the puzzles are so specific to move to the next game.

### *Heroku*

From what I understand, Heroku is made for CI, which stands for Continuous Integration. What I found on "codeship.com" is that Continuous Integration is the practice of intergrating changes from different developers in the team into a mainline as early as possible, in best cases several times a day. This makes sure the code individual developers work on doesn't divert too much. When you combine the process with automated testing, continuous integration can enable your code to be dependable.
So to me, this looks like the master and branch stuff we've been talking about in class. From what I've researched, you start with creating a repo in Github and write your code. You also have to link your Github account to Heroku so you can open your repo from Github. You then have to create a temporary app to deploy the code. heroku will detect the language you use and will and will build and deploy the code in the app. Tests will run and it shares whether they passed or failed and if so, you and other team members can manually fix the code and Heroku will re-run it automatically.
When making a game, this would increase productivity on the programming side of development and hopefully decrease the amount of bugs significantly. You can have seperate programming teams dedicated to sections of the game, such as the menu, animation, and gameplay. Each team would have their own group in github and heroku to all work on their part of the game. Rather than having one guy write code and pass it on to someone else through email or a flashdrive.
