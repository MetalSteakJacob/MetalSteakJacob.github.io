### *Heroku*

From what I understand, Heroku is made for CI, which stands for Continuous Integration. What I found on "codeship.com" is that Continuous Integration is the practice of intergrating changes from different developers in the team into a mainline as early as possible, in best cases several times a day. This makes sure the code individual developers work on doesn't divert too much. When you combine the process with automated testing, continuous integration can enable your code to be dependable.
So to me, this looks like the master and branch stuff we've been talking about in class. From what I've researched, you start with creating a repo in Github and write your code. You also have to link your Github account to Heroku so you can open your repo from Github. You then have to create a temporary app to deploy the code. heroku will detect the language you use and will and will build and deploy the code in the app. Tests will run and it shares whether they passed or failed and if so, you and other team members can manually fix the code and Heroku will re-run it automatically.
When making a game, this would increase productivity on the programming side of development and hopefully decrease the amount of bugs significantly. You can have seperate programming teams dedicated to sections of the game, such as the menu, animation, and gameplay. Each team would have their own group in github and heroku to all work on their part of the game. Rather than having one guy write code and pass it on to someone else through email or a flashdrive.
