# Synopsis
The whole game is you killing time while waiting for whatever it is you're loading to finish. I wouldn't really consider it a game, but more of a prank maybe?

# Game Play Summary
I started the game without a clue of what to do. I only see 3 objects on a windows xp desktop screen, "Shindows Shop", "Earn Money" and the loading bar. I click on the "Earn Money" button and simply hands you free cash. But it costs you patience because it only gives you around 2 to 12 bucks for every click. You can use the money in the "Shindows Shop" to buy expensive stuff that's suppost to speed of the loading, but I don't think it does.
## Playability
Easy to play, and it's fun the first time< but I would'nt play it again.
### Single/Multiplayer
Single
### Controls
Simple mouse clicks work great and the arrow keys just as expected for a mini game you can buy.

# Bugs
I found no bugs. The game is too simple and easy to have any.
# Final Thoughts
I was bored to death, but when I finally found out what I was loading, it was worth it.
