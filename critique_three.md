# Synopsis
The game is strange. I think it's supposed to be based off a band. So far it's super slow but seems easy to play.

# Game Play Summary
The game play is awful. There are no directions except for random useless quotes, floating in the air. You don't have a real chance, especially if you're a beginner, because enemies come from odd angles while your attacks are too slow and don't align to where the enemies will be, making them almost usless. The only attack that's effective is when you press the S key, it does and area damage attack, but it's slow so you have to time it.
## Playability
Like I've said about the attacks. They don't align with the enemy positions. They are alwasy too low, too high, or just too fast. The game itself is slow, so it throws off your reaction time. When it comes to jumping, it feels like you have to solve an algebra equation, because you have to time it just right. Why do you have to time yur jumps? Because There's fire under you, and the fire's sprite is too big, so you have to jump right over the corner of it, and still have to move fast enough before the platform falls into the fire after you had just jumped over it. It's one of those games where it's a little confusing and hard at the first level, but then bullies you at the second, while the third, which is also the boss battle, is impossible.
### Single/Multiplayer
Single
### Controls
The button choices are the worst. The positions of the buttons do not coordinate with the direction of the attacks at all. Why does D do a diagonal laser? Why does E teleport? Why is F forward attack? Forward attack should be D, teleport should be SHIFT + directional button, and the diagonal laser shouldn't even exist because it's too precise.
# Bugs
From the beginning you choose a character, I assume they are the band members, on a screen where each character is standing, while above them is a picture of the real person. I tried clicking on the character and found out you have to click on the picture of the real guy, not the character that's in the game. Then I decided to change character, but I can't. Once you click on one, that's it. You have no choice but to click start, or restart the entire game.
# Final Thoughts
Needs work on the menu. The levels need rearranging on enemies and fire. The game's script needs cleaning, because it's way too slow for it's quality. It's too obvious they have more lines than needed.
