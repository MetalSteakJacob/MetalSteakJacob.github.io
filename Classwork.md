# Testing Plan

## 1. General Information

### Summary
Fireball
is a budget game for PS2. The player controls a ball of fire, and traverses a landscape 
made of blocks of different materials. As the player sets fire to these blocks, they grow hotter, and 
can set fire to mo
re and more different types of blocks.
The fireball the player controls can also 
rise up in height and the hotter the player gets, the higher they can jump in this fashion.
On each field (level) the player has an ultimate goal of igniting the torch (brazie
r) and thus 
clearing the field 
â€“
but the torch is generally positioned at a high point and out of reach. The 
player must use a combination of platform skills and dynamic environmental features (for 
instance, by burning the supports under the torch down to 
the ground) in order to clear the field. 
Simple, clean cut graphics and controls combine to give an easy to learn but engaging play 
experience.
### Environment/User Community
Traget Clusters, both C3 and C2, so that we can reach a larger audience to spread more word to the H3 and H2 targets.
### Test Objectives
Avatar, temperature, gravity, movment, jumping, slamming, avatar color changes, chains, font size, fields, field reset, blocks, objects, fire spread, burning out, polling blocks, melting, collapsing, gravilty for melting objects, pushing through melting objects, rewards, texts, quests, hub, paths, saving, high level states, start, settings, language select screen, language select, autosave settings, settings load, publisher logo, developer logo, title screen, autoload, start up, burn field list object, begin, pause, continue, quit, repeat field button, exit, field clear, last field?, next field, autosave, field list clear, audio, puzzles, credits, 
### Acceptance Criteria
Estimated number of defect or internal test acceptance criteria ???
### References
List any reference documents ???

## 2. Plan
### Test Description
Movment and jumping controls, including rolling and camera view. Menues, such as pause, main, settings, and languages. Texts and credits, and overall structure of the game, such as the goals, progress, and rewards.
### Test Team
The developers will have a test team to find any bugs in the menu systems or in the avatar and it's movment.
