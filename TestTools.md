Different view modes.

Keyboard Shortcuts.

Yes

## Does this tool allow tester to link requirements or defects to test cases?

I think so. I see that it lets you leave comments on ever test case.

## If it is an automated tool, does it work with web-based tools? What languages (Java, .NET)?

It is web based, it can link to other programs such as Github and JIRA. I can't find the laguages for TestRail. The closest I could find was another program linked to it, called SmartInspect, which uses .NET, Java, and Delhpi. So What I understand is that TestRail is just for testing and not for writing any kind of code, but even then that wouldn't make sense to me, because you still need the languages to test any case.
