# Synopsis
The game is both single and multipalyer. The game takes place in an apocalyptic world where theres is no water, yet the sky is always covered in circleing storm clouds, and is over run by zombies. You can craft as well. It's very similar to minecraft but focuses more on the survival aspect rather than creative.

# Game Play Summary
There is an Endurance mode, a Survival mode, Dragon mode, and Creative mode.
Regardless of the different modes, the over all goal is to survive, unless on creative. Dragon and creative mode are locked and can be unlocked through specific tasks. Endurance is to see how far you can travel from the starting point without dying, survival is just like minecraft survival. You mine, fight monsters, build and craft tools to help you live. Dragon mode is endless waves of dragons trying to kill you and you must survive against them. Creative is actually really boring. You can build whatever you want, but there's no monsters and you can't change it to survival after you're done building, so it defeats the purpose.
## Playability
It's very playable as far as understanding it.
