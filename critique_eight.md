# Synopsis
The game is both single and multipalyer. The game takes place in an apocalyptic world where theres is no water, yet the sky is always covered in circleing storm clouds, and is over run by zombies. You can craft as well. It's very similar to minecraft but focuses more on the survival aspect rather than creative.

# Game Play Summary
There is an Endurance mode, a Survival mode, Dragon mode, and Creative mode.
Regardless of the different modes, the over all goal is to survive, unless on creative. Dragon and creative mode are locked and can be unlocked through specific tasks. Endurance is to see how far you can travel from the starting point without dying, survival is just like minecraft survival. You mine, fight monsters, build and craft tools to help you live. Dragon mode is endless waves of dragons trying to kill you and you must survive against them. Creative is actually really boring. You can build whatever you want, but there's no monsters and you can't change it to survival after you're done building, so it defeats the purpose.
## Playability
It's very playable as far as understanding it. Moving is a little hard, because the FPS is pretty low and that makes it hard for when you're trying to get away from zombies. You also don't jump over blocks, you can simply walk up them like stairs, so that can confuse your eyes a bit. Battling monsters can be really hard. You have to always be prepared. Like Minecraft, you have an inventory and a quick inventory on the bottom of the screen, but the buttons are different and is a little harder to use, especially when you're at the wrong place at the wrong time. Now the monsters, zombies, aliens, whatever it may be, when up close to you, you move slower, so it's harder to get away. Zombies are also very overpowering. They run faster than you, jump higher than you and deal more damage than you. They hit so hard that one hit can leave you with 2 points of health. Luckily you regain health almost instantly, so I guess that's balanced.
### Single/Multiplayer
Both, but when it's multiplayer, the game can move a little slower but not by much. It's also hard to deal with other players, but that's any game. A hacker joining your game is also pretty high. There's a trick they'll do, where they join your game, but some how cheat to get a rocket launcher. They then wait for you to be next to your crate with all your stuff and fire, killing you and destroying the crate, then stealing everything you had and leave the game.
### Controls
Controls are good, the only thing I have a problem with is the inventory. 'Y' is to craft while in the inventory and 'X' drops items, so there's really no quick way to move items like in Minecraft. So you just have to move quick and hope nothing kills you. Or find a safe spot and move your items around the way you need.
# Bugs
The only major bug I found was sometimes your character will get stuck between 2 blocks, facing the corner like you're in time out. Sometimes it's against walls too. I think it has something to do with you're speed, because it's repeatable, but it's a 50% chance to work. I actually don't mind this bug because it lets you see caves underground so it helps you find what you need.
# Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed this game, I meant to play it for an hour but ended up being 6. There's a lot to do and a lot of action and thrill for a Minecraft wanna be, but I personally think this game is better than Minecraft. The world is 6 million blocks wide, you can craft guns, there's aliens and alien weapons, including light sabers, there is a hell and heaven, crashed space ships and Dragons. Dragons make great boss battles in this game, especially with groups. Theres is also a miner's paradise, where the land is nothing but ore of all kinds, from copper to diamonds, all at your feet. The devil also makes several appearances. Before you see him, you can hear his laugh, which scares off most players because he does one hit KO's, And he doesn't die. He just leaves and comes back to fight again. This is a game I would play again and probably more often than most games.
