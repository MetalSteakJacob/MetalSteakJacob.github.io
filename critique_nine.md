# Synopsis
The game is a turn based RPG, it's similar to final fantasy, but also like pokemon in a way. For ever dungeon you raid, you have a chance of having one of the enemies join your party. You can even make them stronger by putting them in stables with other familiars like them and they basically grow or level up.

# Game Play Summary
The game seemed really boring at first. It starts you off with creating your character with not much of a selection to features. Then you go to your first dungeon to learn how to play and afterwards, you're sent to the market where other players hangout to buy stuff or go to other levels.
## Playability
It's very easy to know where to go. The dungeons are super small and all you do is defeat the enemies. Very simple and easy. The whole familiar thing, where you have enemies join your party is a little weird at first. I've played for an hour and a half and still can't figure out how to get more familiars. You can equippment too but that was straight forward and didn't need any instructions.
### Single/Multiplayer
It's online multiplayer. PVP seems to work fine. There is a raid mode, but it looks like I have to be a high level for that, so I won't be able to criticise that part. The rest of the gameplay is you raiding dungeons by yourself and going to the market with other players.
### Controls
I really don't like that you have to click on the screen and your character automatically walks to where you clicked. It's weird and it makes me feel like im not entirely in control. No buttons are assigned for a specific purposes other than the movement. Everything else is just icons to determine an attack or open another menu such as the stables to see your familiars.
# Bugs
I was about to get another familiar which cost me 2000 gold and I never got it. I was in the middle of a battle when he just came walking across the screen to say he likes me and would like to join. I had a choice of spending gems on him or gold. I chose gold and never saw him again.
# Final Thoughts
Overall the game is pretty fun, I can't play games as much as I'd like sadly, but if I did, I would play this more often. I like the mixture of final fantasy and pokemon. I like the satisfaction of getting a new familiar and upgrading them, while I level up myself and gain new items and equipment to make myself stronger.
