# Synopsis
The game is a turn based RPG, it's similar to final fantasy, but also like pokemon in a way. For ever dungeon you raid, you have a chance of having one of the enemies join your party. You can even make them stronger by putting them in stables with other familiars like them and they basically grow or level up.

# Game Play Summary
The game seemed really boring at first. It starts you off with creating your character with not much of a selection to features. Then you go to your first dungeon to learn how to play and afterwards, you're sent to the market where other players hangout to buy stuff or go to other levels.
